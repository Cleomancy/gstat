# Glorious Status

![slstatus logo](slstatus.svg)

## Rice:
I use DWM with slstatus, st is my terminal and dmenu is my god.
This is my build of slstatus that I use to monitor my pc.
I don't have to but I made it its own repo in case I ever patch it for some reason.

## Prerequisites:
I use arch btw,
```
pacman -Sy base-devel xorg-server xorg-xinit libxinerama libxft feh unclutter ttf-font-awesome ttf-hack
```
You can already guess my dotfiles.

## Install:
```
cd gstat/
sudo make clean install
```
